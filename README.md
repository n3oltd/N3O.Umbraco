This repo contains the N3O Umbraco extensions. These are a series of NuGet packages that extend the functionality of the [Umbraco CMS](https://umbraco.com). As well as providing generic functionality they provide ready made integration with [N3O Cloud](https://n3o.ltd/) services.

Extensions work with Umbraco 13 or later.

Extensions do not provide any HTML, CSS or other UI. They are designed to integrate seamlessly with any standard Umbraco template and allow your site to retain a distinctive look and feel.

## Demo Site

The solution includes a demo site that both illustrates much of the functionality and also provides a useful starting point for building new sites. The easiest way to get started is to run the `DemoSite.Web` project in the solution, follow the Umbraco install wizard and then navigate to _Settings / uSync_. From here import _Settings_ first, followed by _Content_. This will create all of the demo data types, content types and content.
